# Section 12.2: Browsersync

### Installation
To install Browsersync you'll first need to have Node.js and NPM installed. For more 
information see the SO documentation on Installing and Running Node.js.
Once your project is set up you can install Browsersync with the following command:
```js
$ npm install browser-sync -D
```
This will `install Browsersync` in the local node_modules directory and save it to 
your developer dependencies. If you'd rather install it `globally use the -g` flag in 
place of the `-D` flag.
